# Halo 5 API

WARNING -- Still under heavy development, will be for the forseeable few weeks at least.

## Usage

See Unit tests for examples.

## Testing

In order to test the library, you must put your apiKey into a file called apiKey 
under lib/src/test/secure.  This will be ignored by git.  If you are not developing
the library itself, and only using it, then stop trying to test it =)
